## About

The Planning for Open Grants project is advised by an external advisory committee, selected from among domain experts and stakeholders. This group shares their respective knowledge and experience around four key areas: (1) funding workflows and technical infrastructure; (2) community engagement in open access; (3) academic peer review and reward systems; and (4) collaborative digital library initiatives.
